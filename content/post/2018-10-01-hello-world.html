<p>This has been something I have wanted to start for a while, my own blog. I’ve had a couple of attempts at blogging before and enjoyed it for the most part. What’s more, pretty much everyone whose career path I have looked to learn from has suggested starting a blog to display your skills, whether that be about football (of the soccer variety) analysis or any other data science work. A blog can be a public portfolio of my work, evidence of my capabilities for everyone to see. Others have pointed out that it can also serve as a record of my personal progress and a collection of all the topics I delve into and try to understand, which is great. I don’t have to always put up posts that are going to thrill readers or impress a potential employer. It feels free.</p>
<p>The topics I’m thinking I’ll write about here look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explanation of Machine Learning terms/techniques</li>
<li>Data projects. There are so many aspects of working with data I’d like to cover here.</li>
<li>Layman distillation of ML/DL research papers. I’ve had to do a couple of these in grad school and found it really useful. It will probably take the most time.</li>
<li>Very likely football.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it’s insanely cool that you have found this post and are reading up to this point. I hope you stick around. I promise posts that are mostly interesting, sometimes trivial, but always personal.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
