My name is Gopalakrishnan Shanker Rajhan. If that's too complex for you (and it mostly is) I prefer you call me Krishna.

What else do you need?

### My History

I grew up in the beautiful coastal city of Chennai, in India. I studied Mechanical Engineering for my undergraduate degree and followed that up with a Master's in Statistics. This website is inspired by what I learnt during the latter. If you're interested in hiring me, you can find more details [here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29)
