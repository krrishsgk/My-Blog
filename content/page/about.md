My name is Gopalakrishnan Shanker Rajhan. If that's too complex for you, I prefer you call me Krishna.

What else do you need?

I grew up in the hottest and most beautiful place on Earth - Chennai, in India. I studied Mechanical Engineering for my undergraduate degree and followed that up with a Master's in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This websites inspired by what I thought about and learnt during my master's. I've talked about the purpose of this blog [here](https://www.gopalakrishnan.me/2019/02/01/why-i-blog/)

If you want to discuss a post of mine or give feedback, you can drop a mail to hire(at)gopalakrishnan(dot)me. If you're interested in hiring me, you can find more details [here](https://github.com/krrishsgk/Resume-for-Blog/raw/master/SGK_Resume.pdf)
