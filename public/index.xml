      <description>IntroductionSometimes, when I’m reading about an event that happened in the 2000s or reminiscing with friends about the past, one topic always stands out as something to be marveled at - the pace of technology. 12 years back, the first iPhone had just been released. It did not have an app store. Literally nobody had a ’smart’phone. Today, its presence is unavoidable in urban settings. I inevitably trip over how much the landscape of personal tech has changed since then.</description>

      <description>This has been something I have wanted to start for a while. Pretty much everyone whose career path I have looked to learn from has suggested starting a blog to display your skills, whether that be about football (of the soccer variety) analysis or any other data science work. A blog can be a public portfolio of my work, evidence of my capabilities for everyone to see. Others have pointed out that it can also serve as a record of my personal progress and a collection of all the topics I delve into and try to understand, which is great.</description>

      <description>My name is Gopalakrishnan Shanker Rajhan. If that&amp;rsquo;s too complex for you, I prefer you call me Krishna.
What else do you need?
I grew up in the hottest and most beautiful place on Earth - Chennai, in India. I studied Mechanical Engineering for my undergraduate degree and followed that up with a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This websites inspired by what I thought about and learnt during my master&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
