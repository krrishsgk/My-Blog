      <description>This article is a slight edit from a group project paper I had done as a part of the coursework for STAT430 - Applied Machine Learning
IntroductionThe problem of drug abuse is a pressing concern. It has numerous factors associated with it that include environmental, social, psychological and economic. There has been plenty of coverage towards the social and economic factors. Here, we consider the psychological.

      <description>This has been something I have wanted to start for a while. Pretty much everyone whose career path I have looked to learn from has suggested starting a blog to display your skills, whether that be about football (of the soccer variety) analysis or any other data science work. A blog can be a public portfolio of my work, evidence of my capabilities for everyone to see. Others have pointed out that it can also serve as a record of my personal progress and a collection of all the topics I delve into and try to understand, which is great.</description>

      <description>My name is Gopalakrishnan Shanker Rajhan. If that&amp;rsquo;s too complex for you (and it mostly is) I prefer you call me Krishna.
What else do you need?
I grew up in the beautiful coastal city of Chennai, in India. I studied Mechanical Engineering for my undergraduate degree and followed that up with a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This website is inspired by what I thought about and learnt during my master&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
